First, I changed my working directory to the lab7 directory by typing `cd l <Tab><Enter>` (*I pressed tab to autocomplete to lab7/*); "cd" is used to change directories. Then, I ran the JUnit tests via the bash script. I typed `bash te <Tab><Enter>` (*I pressed tab to autocomplete to test.sh*).

4. <br>![Image](open_file_vim.png)</br>
In order to access the content of the file, I opened it using the vim command. I typed `vim Li <Tab> . <Tab><Enter>` (*The first tab autocompletes the file name to ListExamples, then the tab after the . autocompletes the input to ListExamples.java*).

5. <br>![Image](fixed_line.png)</br>
To get to the line that needs editting, I used the searched for index1 and went to the last occurance of index1. I typed `/index1 <Enter><Shift+N>`. The "/" is used to indicate search for the text that follows. Shift+N, or the capital N, is used go to the last occurance of the matched text. Then, I editted the line so it says index2 instead of index1. I typed `<E><R><2>`. The command "E" moves the cursor to the last character of the current word. The command "R" means replace the character the cursour is currently. "2" is typed after after "R" to replace the character the cursor is on with "2". Finally, to save the changes and exit the file, I typed `:wq`; "w" command is used to save and the "q" is used to exit.
