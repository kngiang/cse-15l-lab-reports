# Lab Report 5

## Part 1

**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**
Windows, VSCode Terminal

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**
I am working on the grader bash script from Lab 6. When I input a submission contains a file that is within a nested directory, the grader should be able to locate the file and run to grade the submission. However, the output actually states that the submission is incorrect.


**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**
